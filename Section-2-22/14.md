Primary Key

How does Django handle primary key assignment?

Django handles primary key assignment automatically for each model. When a new instance of a model is created without explicitly defining a primary key, Django assigns an integer primary key (usually named 'id') that auto-increments. Here's how it works:

Unique Identifier: The primary key serves as a unique identifier for each record in the database table. No two rows can have the same primary key value, ensuring the uniqueness of records.

Auto-Assignment: When you create a new instance of a model and save it, Django handles the assignment of this primary key automatically. For instance, if you save a new item in a table, it will get the next available integer as its primary key.

Database Integrity: Even if you have multiple entries with similar fields (like user names), Django will assign unique primary key values to maintain the uniqueness and integrity of database records.

Benefits: The use of primary keys allows for efficient data retrieval. Fetching records based on their primary keys is faster than searching through multiple other fields like names or descriptions.

In summary, Django's automatic primary key assignment simplifies database management and ensures that each record is unique, which aids in data integrity and retrieval efficiency.





Foreign Key

In django, a foreign key is a type of field used to create a many-to-one relationship between two models

A foreign key links one model to another:
1. It is used when:
    A record in Model A is related one record in Model B.
    But Model B can have many related records in Model A.

This is known as a many-to-one relationship.
