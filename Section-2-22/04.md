Database in django

Views - Functions that handle incoming URL request and send back HTTPResponse



What is a database - A database is an organised collection of data stored electronically

The databases are solely used to store the user generated or user created data


We make use of a browser to send request to the application, and the application then interacts with the database to fetch that particular user data, and the database returns that data to the application, and then the application returns that data to us.


An application is a collection of code and then it is a collection of data.
And therefore, you cannot have these things together that means these things need to be separated.

Data in a database is stored in form of a tables.

A database table is simply a collection of rows and columns where each column represents the attribute we want to save
