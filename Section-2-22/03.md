<!-- Creating a Django App -->

Apps

Splitting your project into multiple apps makes your project alot easier


Views.py

Views in django is nothing but something which processes the user request
So the job of views.py is to accept the request, analyze the request which it 
actually has received, and then send back an appropriate response


How django URLs work internally?

```bash
django -> ROOT_URLCONF -> 'mysite.urls' -> Matching with incoming request -> Call the view

```
