What is a backend framework?

We send a request from our browser as client and the server reponds with appropriate responses.
These servers are programmed before hand to send out responses

How to Program Servers

To program servers, we can use any back-end programming language

Popular back-end programming
1. Python
2. Java
3. Go
4. PHP
5. C#
6. Ruby
7. Rust


PROBLEM?

Coding a backend/server is not easy at all.

1. Handling incoming request
2. Building routing logic
3. Integrating databases
4. Session management
5. Handling authentication
6. Security
and a lot more....


Better Approach in Development

1. Programming backend from scratch requires an investment of skills and time.
2. It requires reinventing the wheel.
3. Instead of using a programming language to program our servers from scratch, we use
backend frameworks.
4. Backend frameworks do all the heavy lifting for us.
